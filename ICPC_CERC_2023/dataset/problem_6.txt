Alice and Bob are playing a game in the sand outside their mansion. A circle representing
the Moon is drawn somewhere, and they each also pick a place to stand (inside, on the
edge, or outside the Moon). The goal of the game is that one of the players runs to the
other as fast as possible, while also touching the Moon during the run.
Given the positions of the Moon, Alice, and Bob, find the length of the shortest path
that starts at one of the players, touches (or crosses) the edge or the interior of the Moon,
and ends at the position of the other player.

## Input data
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. It’s followed by T lines, each
containing 7 space-separated integers x_A, y_A, x_B, y_B, x_C, y_C, r, representing coordinates
of Alice, A = (x_A, y_A), Bob, B = (x_B, y_B), the center of the circle, C = (x_C, y_C), and its
radius r.

## Input limits
• 1 ≤ T ≤ 103
• −103 ≤ x_A, y_A, x_B, y_B, x_C, y_C ≤ 103
• 0 ≤ r ≤ 103

## Output data
For each test case output a single decimal number representing the length of the shortest
path from A to B that also touches at least one point inside or on the edge of a circle
with the center C and radius r. The solution will be considered correct if the relative or
absolute error compared to the official solution is within 10^{−6}.
