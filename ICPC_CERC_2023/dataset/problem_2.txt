Your local cake shop is making a business plan for the next few months. The bakers
have C different recipes, each requiring their own set of ingredients and tools. During the
baking, the ingredients are consumed, but the tools are not and can be reused for other
recipes. Currently, the bakery has no ingredients or tools – they were all destroyed in the
recent floods or taken away by the tax bureau.
The son of the main chef managed to convince everyone to only bake each type of
cake once. Individuals on the internet are supposedly happy to pay extra to be the only
owners of their own unique Nutty-Fudge Tart (NFT). In fact, the son has already gone
ahead and estimated how much money they can earn for each type of cake. Now bakers
are looking at each other, trying to figure out which types of cake to prepare for maximum
profit. You are given the costs of all ingredients, tools, and prices of cakes. Your task is
to determine how much profit the bakers can make.
Input data
The first line contains three integers: G, C, and T, the number of ingredients, the number
of recipes, and the number of different tools in them, respectively. The second line contains
C space-separated integers c_1, ... , c_C, the prices of each cake. The third line contains G
space-separated integers g_1, ... , g_G, representing the prices of each ingredient. The fourth
line contains T space-separated integers t_1, ... , t_T , representing the prices of all tools.
This is followed by C lines, each containing G space-separated integers a_{i,j} , corresponding
to the amount of ingredient j in cake i.
Finally, this is followed by C lines of the following format: the i-th row starts with
an integer n_i, the number of tools required for i-th cake. This is followed by ni space-separated
integers b_{i,k}, indicating that we need tool b_{i,k} to prepare cake i (listed tools are
distinct).

## Input limits
• 1 ≤ G, C, T ≤ 200
• 0 ≤ c_i
, t_i ≤ 109
• 0 ≤ g_j
, a_{i,j} ≤ 108
• 0 ≤ n_i ≤ T
• 1 ≤ b_{i,k} ≤ T

## Output data
Print a single number: the maximum profit that the cake shop can make.
