Every non-negative integer n may be written as the sum of the squares of four integers:
n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2
By allowing subtraction, n may be written in many more ways; in fact infinitely many.
In this problem you will count the number of different ways to express an input n as a sum or difference of
four squares with several restrictions:
First, we need to decide what different means.
Any of a, b, c, d may be replaced by its negative. We do not want to count these as different so we will only
count different squared values.
Reordering a, b, c, d does not give a different representation.
So, we define a plus minus four square representation of a non-negative integer n as a sequence of four
perfect squares in non-increasing order with plus or minus signs whose computation results in n.
In addition, we add the following restrictions:
• The first square must be no more than n to avoid having infinitely many representations.
• If the same square appears multiple times all appearances must be preceded by (a possibly implicit)
plus sign or all must be preceded by a minus sign. This avoids something like:
64 + 36 - 36 + 0
• A square of zero must be preceded by a plus sign.

For example, the only sums of squares which add to 64 are:
64 + 0 + 0 + 0
16 + 16 + 16 + 16

If we allow minus signs with the above additional restrictions we have the following which each sum up to
64:
64 + 25 - 16 - 9
64 - 25 + 16 + 9
64 + 0 + 0 + 0
49 + 49 - 25 - 9
49 + 36 - 25 + 4
49 + 25 - 9 - 1
49 + 16 - 1 + 0
36 + 36 - 9 + 1
36 + 36 - 4 - 4
36 + 25 + 4 - 1
36 + 16 + 16 - 4
16 + 16 + 16 + 16
Write a program which takes as input a non-negative integer n and outputs a count of the number of different
four square plus minus representations of n.
