Quicksort is a recursive sorting algorithm developed in 1959 by Tony Hoare. One of the major steps in the
algorithm is the partition step: given an element p in the array (the pivot element) rearrange the elements in
the array as shown below where all the values in XL are ≤ p and all elements in XR are > p.

Below shows an array before and after it’s been partitioned with the pivot element 13. Note that
the elements in XL and XR are typically not in sorted order and either one of them could be empty.
Before: 13 94 99 1 53 20 63 8 79 11
After: 1 11 8 13 53 20 63 99 79 94

How a partition is executed and how a pivot element is selected are fascinating questions but are not of
interest to us. What we would like you to do is the following: given an array, determine all the values that
could be the pivot value assuming the array has been partitioned, or determine that the array has not been
partitioned.

## Input
Input starts with a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) denoting the size of the array. Following this are n
positive integers indicating the values in the array. All values are unique and ≤ 10^6.

## Output
Output m = the number of values in the array that could have served as pivot values to partition the array,
followed by the pivot values in the order that they appear in the input. If m > 100 just output the first 100
of these pivot values. Note that a value of m = 0 indicates that the array is not partitioned.
