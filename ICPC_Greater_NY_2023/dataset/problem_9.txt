A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward
as forward, such as madam or racecar or 1881. Phrase palindromes ignore capitalization, punctuation, and
word boundaries. For example:
Madam I'm Adam.

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of
two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel
Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. The International Morse code for letters and digits (the code
does not distinguish between upper and lower case) is:
A	.-	B	-...
C	-.-.	D	-..
E	.	F	..-.
G	--.	H	....
I	..	J	.---
K	-.-	L	.-..
M	--	N	-.
O	---	P	.--.
Q	--.-	R	.-.
S	...	T	-
U	..-	V	...-
W	.--	X	-..-
Y	-.--	Z	--..
0	-----	1	.----
2	..---	3	...--
4	....-	5	.....
6	-....	7	--...
8	---..	9	----.

A word, number or phrase is a Morse Code Palindrome if the morse code for the letters and digits in the
word, number or phrase reads the same backwards or forwards (ignoring spaces between character codes.

For example:
159
.---- ..... ----.

Footstool
..-. --- --- - ... - --- --- .-..

Write a program which takes as input a string and determines the smallest number of characters to append
to the end of the word to make it a Morse Code Palindrome.

## Input
Input consists of a single line containing a string of up to 30 capital letters and/or digits possibly including
spaces and punctuation.

## Output
The output consists of a single line.
If the input string is already a Morse Code Palindrome, output the digit 0. Otherwise output the number of
characters to append, followed by a single space followed by a string containing capital letters and/or digits
to append to make the input a Morse Code Palindrome.
Since there may be more than one valid answer (see samples 2 and 3 below), a result will be judged correct
if the number of appended characters is less than or equal to the judgesâ€™ answer and the input followed by
your output is a Morse Code Palindrome.
